ðŸš€ Description
Reads a string from user input, counts how many times each vowel appears, and prints the most frequent one along with its count.
Written in C++ for speed, pain, and complete domination of beginner-level string logic.

ðŸ§  What I Learned
How to use map<char, int> to track character frequencies

Range-based for loops and structured bindings in C++23

That forgetting to initialize keys in a map is a fast track to debugging purgatory

How to translate clean Python logic into syntactically rigid but performant C++

ðŸ’» Tech Stack
C++23 (because semicolons build character)

Standard Template Library (STL): map, string, iostream

Your tears

ðŸ”— Live Demo / Screenshots
Not a web app.
Run it in your terminal like the 1990s coder you were always meant to be.

ðŸ“‚ How to Run It
bash
Copy
Edit
# Compile the code
g++ -std=c++23 -o vowel_counter vowel_counter.cpp

# Run it
./vowel_counter

# Example input:
communication

# Example output:
The most prominent vowel in your word was: 'i', appearing 2 times.
